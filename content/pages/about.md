### Curie Yoo

Hi, I'm Curie Yoo. <br>
I love to learn, code, and create new things.
Curiosity is the source of my learning, passion, and challenge.
<br>

I majored in computer engineering at Seoul National University. I worked as a front-end intern at Travelflan and NAVER Corp. and participated in projects using Vue.js and React.js. 
<br>

Working as a front-end developer and studying things related to it are fun. When I do them, I become more immersed than anything else. I love the front-end development because they are the things I enjoy the most and I am motivated to do well.
